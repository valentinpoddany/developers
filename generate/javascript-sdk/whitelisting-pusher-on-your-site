        <p>To deliver an amazing live chat experience to you and all your leads and customers, we are working hand in hand with Pusher.</p>

        <p>If your site only allows your scripts to make requests to a few specific websites, in order for Slaask live chat to work properly, you should add Pusher to your list of authorized domains.</p>

        <p>You should authorize the <code>pusher.com</code> domain and/or the <code>js.pusher.com</code> subdomain according to your external script filtering solution.</p>
